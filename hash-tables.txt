A hash table is a data structure in which each data value is associated with a key.

2. What is hashing?

Hashing is taking a key of any value (number, string, or boolean) and creating a specific hash code, which is used to locate a specific key-value pair.

3. How does a hash table store data?

Data is stored with a value-key relationship. Each piece of data has its own unique key.

4. How are hash tables and objects different?

From what I've found, they are essentially the same exact thing, with the exception that objects only support string keys, whereas hash tables (maps) support any key type.
