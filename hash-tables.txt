1. What is a hash table?

A hash table is a data structure in which each data value is associated with a key.

2. What is hashing?

Hashing is taking a key of any value (number, string, or boolean) and creating a specific hash code, which is used to locate a specific key-value pair.

3. How does a hash table store data?

Data is stored with a value-key relationship. Each piece of data has its own unique key.

4. How are hash tables and objects different?

From what I've found, they are essentially the same exact thing, with the exception that objects only support string keys, whereas hash tables (maps) support any key type.

5. Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:

  -A list of pets and their unique names.
    hash table

  -The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend.
    object

  -The name and location of every company in a given city.
    hash table

  -All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual.
    hash table

  -The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact.
    object

####Programming Questions

1. Create a hash table that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers.

let hash = (string, max) => {
  let hash = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    hash += string.charCodeAt(i);
  }
  return hash % max;
};

let HashTable = function() {

  let storage = [];
  const storageLimit = 100;

  this.add = function(key,value) {
    let index = hash(key, storageLimit);
    if (storage[index] === undefined) {
      storage[index] = [
        [key,value]
      ];
    } else {
      let inserted = false;
      for (let i = 0; i < storage[index].length; i++) {
        if (storage[index][i][0] === key) {
          storage[index][i][1] = value;
          inserted = true;
        }
      }
      if (inserted === false) {
        storage[index].push([key,value]);
      }
    }
  };

  this.lookup = function(key) {
    let index = hash(key, storageLimit);
    if (storage[index] === undefined) {
      return undefined;
    } else {
      for (let i = 0; i < storage[index].length; i++) {
        if (storage[index][i][0] === key) {
          return storage[index][i][1];
        }
      }
    }
  };

};

let avengers = new HashTable();
avengers.add(1234,{name:'Stark', address:'Stark Tower'})
avengers.add(5678,{name:'Peter Parker',address:'Queens'});
avengers.add(9012,{name:'Thor',address:'Asgard'});

console.log(avengers.lookup(1234));
console.log(avengers.lookup(5678));
console.log(avengers.lookup(9012));


2. Create a hash table that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory and quantity.
3. Create a hash table that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date.
