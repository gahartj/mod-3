1. What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?

  Stack uses LIFO, queue uses FIFO. Stack uses push and pop, queue uses enqueue and dequeue. An object is removed from a stack from the top. In queue, object is removed from the beginning. In a stack, an object is pushed on top of the collection during insertion operation. In a queue, new object is inserted at the end.

2. What are the similarities between stacks and queues?

  They both are a collection of objects.

3. Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?

  Stack for undo- LIFO and Queue for redo. undo last, redo

####Programming Questions

1. Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".

  

2. Implement the pop method of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure. Since the internal list is not the same as defined in the checkpoint, it may help to rewrite the pseudocode first.



>To delete an item, take all of the elements in the queue one at a time and put them at the end of the queue, except for the last one which should be removed and returned.

1. Implement the enqueue and dequeue methods defined in the checkpoint inside your own Queue class.
